The hardest part of this assignment has been to implement the reporting and reportingIO class. As I started trying to code the
Auctionhouse class, I was struggling to find a way to connect the name of an auctionhouse to the list of items it had sold.
I first started trying out arrays, which in my opinion complicated things to the point where I had to start over again.
The advice I got from the tutorials was to use lists instead, which was something I had never used before. Eventually I managed to
piece something together in the Auctionhouse class using lists, however since I was still new to the concept of lists, I was completely
lost when I started trying to work on the 2 remaining classes.   
I'm a bit dissapointed at myself for not being able to figure out these things in time for the deadline, and the extension being declined
since "All students are expected to complete all assessed work, in line with their peers on modules and programmes." I'm able to use tools 
online that would help me finish the coursework on time, although it wouldn't help me become a more competent programmer. 

On the other hand, I do think that its good that I found this project to be challenging. I've gotten a better feel for the language, and
been able to develop an understanding of how the foundations of a java program is built. The most prominent example being the getter
and setter methods, which in the beginning I struggled to see the point of. After I started using them in the constructor methods, I 
found myself having a clearer understanding of how my code was running, since I felt like I was more in charge of where the fields were
being used and how.
This aspect of the assignment helped me feel more comfortable coding in java because I wasn't just creating a getter and setter method, 
but I was realizing the utility it provides later down the line as I was creating the e.g. soldOverPrice method in the AuctionHouse class.
